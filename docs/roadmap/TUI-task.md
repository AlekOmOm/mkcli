reading the mkcli code (high-level)

main
  ├─ cmd_add / cmd_remove / cmd_list
  │    ├─ several interactive “y/N” prompts
  │    ├─ echo/printf status lines
  ├─ alias_dispatch
  │    ├─ parse_list_targets → prints a tab-separated “help” table
  │    └─ exec_make → exec make …
  └─ global flags: set -euo pipefail

no spinner yet, no colour logic, no width-aware table, no tests that assert UI output.

where the four “gaps” could bite mkcli

gap	where it surfaces in mkcli	why it matters (or not)
term-cap detection & cache	every info/ok/warn/fail/title call we introduce	set -u means uninitialised vars abort the script. make sure ui.sh pre-declares _COLOR_SUPPORT='' before it is first referenced (fixed in the skeleton). also guard tput calls because TERM=dumb is common in CI.
spinner signals	today: unused. future: tempting to wrap exec_make.	problem: exec_make currently execs into make. wrapping it in spinner would remove that exec, spawning an extra shell layer, and we must forward the exit code + INT/TERM ⇒ needs careful refactor (or skip spinner).
width-aware table	parse_list_targets prints target + doc string (help screen).	if we switch to table helper we inherit its multibyte risk. most target names are ASCII, so mis-alignment shows only when someone writes an emoji in a Makefile comment. acceptable, but note it in docs.
test hooks	bats / shunit tests you may add later.	not a runtime bug, but you’ll thank yourself for NO_COLOR=1 + GLYPH_FALLBACK=ascii so golden‐files in tests stay stable.

bottom line
today only the first gap is truly relevant; the other three become concerns only when you extend mkcli (spinner) or its test suite (hooks).

minimal integration plan

# mkcli (top of file)
 set -euo pipefail
 . "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/ui.sh"      # NEW – before registry/link
 . "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/registry.sh"
 . "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/link.sh"

replace ad-hoc echoes

-echo "> adding to PATH"
+info "adding to PATH"
 ...
-printf 'Alias %s already exists, override? [y/N]: ' "$alias_name"
-read -r reply
-[ "$reply" = "y" ] || exit 1
+confirm "override existing alias $alias_name?" || exit 1

follow the same pattern for remove and error paths (fail "unknown command $1").

help/table

inside parse_list_targets (or after its awk/gawk), pipe to table:

parse_list_targets() {
  # produces lines: "$target\t$desc"
  awk ... | table
}


⸻

extra safety tweaks for ui.sh when used under set -u

# at top of ui.sh
_COLOR_SUPPORT=''  # pre-declare to silence -u
_GLYPH_CACHE=''    # optional if you cache wcwidth tests


⸻

advisable next step: CI smoke test

bats/test_color.bats
  @test "color auto-disabled in non-tty" {
    run bash -c 'NO_COLOR=1 MKCLI_YES=1 mkcli add foo /tmp' </dev/null
    [[ $output != *$'\e['* ]]   # no ANSI
  }

that single test will catch 90 % of regressions around the only “real” gap.
