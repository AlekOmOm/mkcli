The golden rules for designing software, particularly in the context of Text User Interfaces (TUIs), can be summarized from the principles of good interface design. Here are key points:

-  **Consistency**: Ensure that actions and commands are consistent across the interface to reduce user confusion. This includes consistent terminology and layout.
-  **Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback for user actions to inform them of the results of their commands, enhancing user confidence.
-  **Error Prevention and Recovery**: Design interfaces that prevent errors where possible and provide clear recovery options when errors occur.
-  **User Control**: Allow users to feel in control of the interface, enabling them to initiate actions and navigate freely.
-  **Efficiency**: Optimize for speed and efficiency, allowing experienced users to perform tasks quickly while still being accessible to novices.
-  **Learnability**: Design interfaces that are easy to learn, with intuitive commands and structures that users can quickly grasp.
-  **Simplicity**: Keep the interface simple and uncluttered, focusing on essential functions to avoid overwhelming users.
-  **Accessibility**: Ensure that the interface is usable for people with varying abilities and disabilities, incorporating accessibility features where necessary.

These principles are derived from broader user interface design guidelines and can be specifically applied to TUIs to enhance usability and user experience.
